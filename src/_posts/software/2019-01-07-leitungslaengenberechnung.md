This is a tool to calculate the minimal needed cross-section of an electrical wire in a building. It refers to **austrian law**.

{% notice danger %}
#### :exclamation: Don't forget to use your brain!

It might sound harsh---but you shouldn't rely on this app as there could be still some bugs in the app.  
Have a look at the code yourself to **verify my calculations**.

{% figure caption:"It looks a bit distracting but you really need those inputs to calculate the cross-section of a wire." %}

## Usage

The app is in german only. If you need this in english please fork the repository on github and modify it to your needs. Feel free to ask if you need help---but I can't promise anything. :wink:

For example we calculate a cable in a single-phase alternating current system.

| Symbol                      | Description |
| ---                         | :---        |
| A \[mm<sup>2</sup>\]        | cross-section that we want to calculate in square-millimeters|
| l \[m\]                     | lenght of the desired wire in meters|
| I \[A\]                     | current in ampere |
| cos                         | [level of efficiency][1] (this is usually something around 0.8) |
| &gamma; \[Sm<sup>-1</sup>\] | [electric conductivity][2] in Siemens/meter (on copper this is 58 &times; 10<sup>6</sup>) |
| U<sub>a</sub> \[V\]         | voltage drop in volts (in Austria this should not be more than max. 3%) |

Usually I calculate with a voltage drop of 1.5%---so there should be enough space to not exceed the 3% given by the power supply company.
