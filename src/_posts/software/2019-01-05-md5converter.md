MD5 Converter converts a user-given string in realtime into a md5 hash.

{% figure caption:"The hash gets generated while you type the string in the textfield." %}

{% endfigure %}

## Usage

The tool is quite outdated now. But it comes quite handy sometimes to generate random strings with a specific lenght.

## Files and Codes

Feel free to fork and adopt the code to your personal needs. While 'Setup' will install the tool with an installer, the source code on github lets you compile your own version and use that instead. Report any issues on the github issues page if you like.
