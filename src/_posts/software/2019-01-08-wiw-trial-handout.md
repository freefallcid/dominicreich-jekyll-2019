Back when I was playing [Battlefield 2 in a clan]({% link _pages/wiw.md %}) we were recruiting new members. Within this recruitment progress we had to announce if someone was accepted as a "beginner member" or not. It was a so-called recruit and we watched him playing over a short time period, mostly two weeks. If we knew people from our servers before it could turn out into a cut-off.

We usually copied the text of another accepted member and replaced names and times to have those posts look nearly the same every time. To get something linear if you want. Now this tool sets the text up for you.

## Usage

All you have to do is filling out the recruits name, if he or she gets a cut-off and the final period on the calendar. Hit <kbd>Generate Text</kbd> and the final text pops up on a second window within a second. On the left side some helpful terms regarding the selected period are displayed.
