A tool for re-sorting the chatlogs from the RCON Service [rconnet.de](http://rconnet.de/). The logs have been stored like normal logfiles and had to be read from bottom to the top. My tool reversed the lines so you could read them from top to bottom like normal. Besides that it supported filtering user-defined words with or without server messages.

{% endfigure %}

## Usage

Very easy to use. Copy the whole chatlog from the website and insert it into the top textfield. Specify the filtering methods and click <kbd>Sort and Filter</kbd>.

## Files and Codes

Feel free to fork and adopt the code to your personal needs. While 'Setup' will install the tool with an installer, the source code on github lets you compile your own version and use that instead. Report any issues on the github issues page if you like.
