In Austria reliable persons over 18 are allowed to buy and carry a blank gun without a firearms license (you're still required to carry the weapon concealed). Other than in Germany you don't have to own a "[small firearms license](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiner_Waffenschein)".

In this article we will have a look at three blank guns: the Röhm RG 96, the Röhm RG 88 and the Zoraki 917. Let's begin with a short description and a small comparison.

## Overview

One of these three guns, the RG 88, has no corresponding "original" weapon---it was built only as a blank gun with no "real big brother". The two other guns do have a "bigger brother": the RG 96 was made to look like the P8 by Heckler & Koch and the Zoraki 917 looks like a Glock 17.

All three guns work in Single Action[^sa] aswell as in Double Action[^da].

[^sa]: When operating in single action the hammer gets cocked by pulling the hammer back or sliding the breech back and the only action to is is pulling the trigger to let the hammer hit the firing pin. The trigger operates one single action only. [More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_(firearms)#Single-action)
[^da]: In double action mode the trigger operates two actions: the hammer gets pulled into its cocked state and instantly gets released to hit the firing pin. [More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_(firearms)#Double-action/single-action)

Let's have a closer look at all those guns.

## Röhm RG 96

The RG 96 (made by Umarex) is a very reliable gun. It has a 9-round magazine and can be used in single and double action. It's heavy slide takes most of the recoil although it makes the weapon a bit too heavy for my taste. This is a single-action/double-action weapon---with a chambered cartridge the first shot can be taken with double-action and the following shot continue using single-action as the breech will cock the hammer.

## Röhm RG 88

Like the RG 96 this is a Umarex production too. The smaller gun is probably made for the use in smaller hands.
