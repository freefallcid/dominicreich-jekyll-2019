Have a look on my little helpers. I hope you find them helpful too :wink:

{% notice %}
#### Some things just right away

- Some tools might be written in english, some in german. The WiW tools are in english. Normally.
- Those tools are open source (except FEWO Preiskalkulation---because I have to remove some hardcoded things before I publish the code) and free to use (MIT License)
- Most tools use the [.NET Framework 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/de-at/download/details.aspx?id=30653)---FEWO Preiskalkulation uses [4.5.2](https://www.microsoft.com/de-at/download/details.aspx?id=42643) (note the links point to a german website)
- The tools use the newer design of Windows---the screenshots have been made without them. For old-school reasons... ;-)
- I am not an advanced programmer, so the code and the project files might miss something or are badly coded---please keep that in mind before using the tools. If you have something to add to the code please let me know, I'd like to upgrade my tools aswell when I find some time for it.

## [MD5 Converter]({% post_url software/2019-01-05-md5converter %})

A simple md5-Hash generator that creates hashes while you type. Easy to copy the hash.

{% figure caption:"Easy to use---type your phrase and it converts the string while you type." %}
  ![Example screenshot](/assets/images/md5convert.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

## [Leitungsl√§ngenberechnung]({% post_url software/2019-01-07-leitungslaengenberechnung %})

This is a tool to calculate the minimal needed cross-section of an electrical wire in a building. It refers to **austrian law**.

{% notice danger %}
#### :exclamation: Don't forget to use your brain!

It might sound harsh---but you shouldn't rely on this app as there could be still some bugs in the app.  
Have a look at the code yourself to verify my calculations.
{% endnotice %}

{% figure caption:"Fill out the textfields and hit **BERECHNEN** to calculate the lenght. On other tabs you find other functions as well." %}

{% endfigure %}

## FEWO Preiskalkulation

At version 2. This app lets you quickly calculate a usual overnight stay. Or a holiday. With or without pets. You can set your own values for different situations (summer/winter; how many people; with kids) and so on.

{% figure caption:"The tool in action. Select the time on the calendar and fill out the fields on the left side. It calculates different things on the fly." %}
  ![Example screenshot](/assets/images/fewo-preis.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The tool was built for my parents---because of that it is made to fit their needs. You might fork the repository and change whatever is needed to fit your needs.

## [WiW RCON Chat]({% post_url software/2019-01-08-wiw-rcon-chat %})

A simple chat viewer to use with [rconnet.de](http://rconnet.de). The chatlogs were produced from bottom to top---that means you had to read those logs from bottom to the top which is not a normal or usual way of how you read things. It was not naturally.

This tool's purpose was re-sorting of the reading direction as well as the possibility to filter for specific words. And quickly remove those server messages at the cost of an additional click.

{% figure caption:"Paste the chatlog on the top textfield. Setup the filter words by entering the word in the top right textfield and hit enter. It gets added to the list below." %}

## [WiW Trial Handout Generator]({% post_url software/2019-01-08-wiw-trial-handout %})

This app creates a standardised text that we used in our clan to respond to a given trial period membership, called recruitment period.

{% figure caption:"Enter the recruits name, select if the recruits gets a cutoff and select the time span on the calendar. Then hit **Generate Text**." %}
