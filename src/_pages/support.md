Hello there. I am hosting this website mainly for one reason---to have all the stuff that I want myself to remember, written down in one place so I can find it again. Besides that I thought that this information might be also helpful to others and maybe it is---maybe it's not. If you find it helpful, please consider supporting me. Below you find different ways how you could do that.
